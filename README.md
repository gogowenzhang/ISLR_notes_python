# ISLR Notes with Python

I am currently reading this baby Bible book of Machine Learning [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)
and find that it is a good way to learn this book by realizing these awosome tables and figures in this book. Hope you will find it helpful too!
